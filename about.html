                <h4>Freelance Illustrator/Graphic Designer</h4>
                <p>It's my goal to create work that sparks joy for all your artistic needs!</p>
                <div class="auto-bio">
                    <p2>I'm a 14 year-old Vietnamese-American artist whose dream is to become a professional illustrator in the art industry!
                        I have loved art and drawing ever since I was very young, but didn't originally think of it as a viable career because
                        "artists only make it post-mortem." However, thanks to the emergence of video games, online entertainment, and other
                        applications of commercial art, I gained the confidence to pursue it seriously. I get excited and inspired whenever I see
                        beautiful promotional art or really cool packaging, so I want to create things that evoke those same feelings of awe
                        for others too! I want to make the kind of art that draws people in and ispires other artists the way amazing illustrations do for me.
                         Some more things that I enjoy a lot are metal music, acting, fashion, and writing. I love working and
                        interacting with other artists and creatives, so if you ever want to collaborate or talk about stuff, just shoot me a message and
                        I'll respond as fast as I can! I know I still have a long way to go and a lot to learn, but I am willing to work hard every
                        single day to be an artist you can support!
                        For any other questions, comments, or inquiries, you can find out how to reach me on my contact page &#x2764;
